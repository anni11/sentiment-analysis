Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Excellent food on the Seine River Cruise. Loved seeing the Eiffel Tower at night. Bus even took us back to our hotel after the Moulin Rouge Show  1

Awesome way to see the Eiffel Tower and experience dinner and a fantastic show!!!! I highly recommend 1

We thought this tour might be a bit cheeky, but it was actually very delightful. The guide for the our pick up and drop off for the river cruise was very clear and organized. The dinner on the cruise was very good considering that it was mass produced for an entire boat. Seeing the Eiffel Tower lit up and reflecting off the Seine was spectacular! Our pick up and drive to visit the Eiffel Tower went smoothly however, upon arrival at the the tower we ere notified that the police had closed down admittance to deal with a potentially dangerous climber on the structure. Viator, in cooperation with the tour operator ParisCityVision, were quick to confirm our refund for this portion of the tour which was no fault of theirs! We transferred over to the Moulin Rouge and by-passed the long line outside and went directly into the theater. Our seats, though in tight quarters, were excellent and the three bottles of Champagne at our table of six accentuated the festive show. The performance at Moulin Rouge was very entertaining and better than we were expecting! After, a separate bus established by Viator took us to our hotel to conclude our wonderful Parisian night experience. The entire evening was well organized and very professionallly conducted		1

Not an amazing day.Thank you	0

This whole trip was amazing. The most spectacular was the Moulin Rouge Show. The talent, the stages, the colors, thee variety, the costumes...all first rate. The only thing that was a negative was the grumpy waiter who seemed to have little to no time to educate us on our drink options 0

This tour was fantastic, it allowed us to make use of the little time we had in the best possible way. It was very well organized 1

What a great night we all had. Our first stop was the Eiffel Tower where we all enjoyed a delicious 3 course dinner from the 1st floor restaurant. Next we were on the Seine river cruise where we experienced the city of lights from our boat. After the cruise we were taken by luxury coach to Montmartre to the wonderful Moulin Rouge Cabaret . After the show we were all dropped home as close to our hotels as possible. A great night of fun, food and entertainment. Well organised too		1

Excellent way to cover Paris in comfort and no stress.		1

Excellent River trip would be a bit boring without dinner. Eiffel Tower brilliant at night. We paid extra ƒ?ª6 each up there to go straight to summit. Worth it. Would do it again. Then we moved on to moulin rouge. Great show. Champagne. Entertaining. Then bus took us to hotel Recommend 1

Very well organized. A true plus that the bus returns you to your hotel at the end of the evening. Wear comfortable shoes and carry fancier ones with you to put on for show if you wish. I noticed some uncomfortable ladies during the first part of the tour. I'm glad I prepared	1

Amazing trip well worth doing, the cruise down the seine was excellent with good food, the eifel tower was amazing and the Moulin Rouge Show is a Must do. The transport provided was also excellent 10 out of 10 trip fantastic night. Just be prepared for a late night as the show doesn't finish until 2 in the morning 0

This tour combined three great experiences in Paris! Started with the dinner on the eiffel tower, the tour guides ensured we got through the security checks and up to the first level on time for dinner. The dinner was delicious, however did feel a little rushed as we went through all three courses in 40 minutes. However I understand the need to be prompt when needing to fit all three of these experiences into the one night so we didnt mind. We then went from dinner to the one hour cruise which was right on sunset which was lovely with the lights coming on as we cruised down the river. After the cruise we were taken to the Moulin Rouge and assisted by the tour guides to skip the line to great seats. Really enjoyed the show and really appreciated the tour dropping us back near our hotel as it was 1.30am by the time we got back. This was a great taste of three different experiences in the one night, we found it amazing 1

Excellent dinner and cruise. Moulin Rouge was so packed they had tables on the stair landings hope there isn't ever a fire!. Review excellent, and the company even drives you back to your hotel at the end of the evening 1

Absolutely magical 1

Was a very lovely evening! Thank you 1

We thoroughly enjoyed our tour with you. Everything was very professionally handled, the tour guides made sure we all understood the instructions and the best part was they dropped us back at our hotel at 1.45 in the morning 1

Very well managed tour. Enjoyed immensely 1

I had a fantastic time on this tour! I got to meet some awesome people at dinner and at the show. It is definitely worth it. It is a bit pricey but now having been in Paris, having this all arranged with transport and not having to worry about anything was well worth it. Highly recommended 1
